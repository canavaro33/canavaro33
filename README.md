## Fun Fact About Me

When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me on the basketball court! 🏀 I believe basketball and data analysis share the same DNA - both require reading patterns, predicting outcomes, and making split-second decisions based on statistics. Just like tracking shooting percentages and player efficiency ratings in basketball, I love finding insights hidden in business data. Game recognizes game! 📊
